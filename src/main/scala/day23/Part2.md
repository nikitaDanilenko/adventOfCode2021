The domain seemed like a very tricky implementation,
which is why I stuck with a manual solution.

Finding the solution was significantly more difficult than in the first part,
because minimization by hand is much less obvious.

For future reference, I needed to get the top row into the following configuration to proceed

```
AB.......D.
```

Also, around the end, one can move `A` instead of `B`, which saves the final bit of energy.
