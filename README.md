## Solutions to (most) puzzles from [Advent of Code 2021](https://adventofcode.com/2021)

While most solutions are programmatic,
there are some that are solved by hand for "simplicity".
Manual solutions are still documented in the corresponding package.

### Usage

This is an `sbt` project. 
You can compile code with `sbt compile`, run it with `sbt run`, and `sbt console` will start a Scala 3 REPL.
